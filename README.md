# Mindwave
Description
Mindwave is an experimental, interactive social media site that translates user posts into a global mood scale. It features real-time posts, likes, and follows, and tracks mood trends on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis.

## Installation
To get started with Mindwave, clone the project from this repo [link](https://github.com/RolandosG/my-nx-workspace). Download my-nx-workspace. Install dependencies. Run the following commands to start the system:

bash
Copy code
nx serve inventory-management-system
nx serve inventory-management-system-api
Note: The project is hosted in a separate Git repository for better organization and due to time constraints for code modification.

## Usage
After creating a user account, you can:

Make a global post every 5 hours, displayed in real-time using WebSockets.
